# Agent Context Update Notes

## Next Steps
In a complete environment, the following command would be executed:
`.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`

This script would:
- Detect which AI agent is in use
- Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
- Add only new technology from the current plan
- Preserve manual additions between markers

## Technologies to Add to Context
- Next.js 16+ with App Router
- FastAPI (Python) framework
- SQLModel ORM
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Better Auth with JWT authentication
- RESTful API design patterns
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Modern web authentication patterns

## Note
This represents the technology additions that would be made to the agent's context based on this planning phase.
